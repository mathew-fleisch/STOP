<b>STOP</b> is a multi-ontology enrichment analysis tool.  It is intended to be used to help from hypothesis about large sets of genes or proteins. The annoations used for enrichment analysis are obtained automatically applying text descriptions of genes and proteins to the <b>NCBO</b> annotator.  Text for genes is found using <b>NCBI</b> entrez gene, and text for proteins is found using UniProt. The text is then run though <b>NCBO</b> annotator with all the available ontologies.  For more information about the <b>NCBO</b> annotator please visit: <a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/" target="_blank">http://bioportal.bioontology.org/</a>

The goal of National Center for Biomedical Ontology (<b>NCBO</b>) is to support biomedical researchers in their knowledge-intensive work, by providing online tools and a Web portal enabling them to access, review, and integrate disparate ontological resources in all aspects of biomedical investigation and clinical practice. A major focus of our work involves the use of biomedical ontologies to aid in the management and analysis of data derived from complex experiments.
